badges

When a widget supports multiple sizes, the first size in the array is the default size of the widget. 
One row/column corresponds to 160px. 
Any dimension above 1x1 will get an additional 10px that represent the gutter between widgets.
e.g. 3 x 2 widget will be 160*3 + 10*2 wide and 160*2 + 10*1 tall = 480+20 wide & 320+10 tall = 500wide, 330tall
The maximum supported size is 4x4.
